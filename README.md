# Heart-attack-prediction-using-svm
in these project, i have heart attack predicition dataset in these dataset we have many columns contain relaed about blood pressure and other related columns which is cause heart attack.before we using algorithm i analyze the column which is mainly important for predicting model i use correlational coefficient then i choose features based on corelational coefiicient after i choose features i import svm classifier for prediction our train and test data also i got good accuarcy and my model predict well based i confirmed  after checking confusion matrix classification
